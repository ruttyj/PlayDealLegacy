## About

Built with React, RxJs, NodeJs & SocketIO
This was a passion project created during the COVID-19 quarantine.
This was my first React, NodeJs, SocketIO project and first time making a multiplayer game, so the game was not architected very cleanly. I have decided to rewrite this game again given what I have learned. Please see https://github.com/ruttyj/PlayDeal/
